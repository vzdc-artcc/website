                        ATC Bookings system, which relays it to third-party services such as VATSIM Radar. As a result,
                        vZDC has no control over how your data is handled beyond the actions available through this
                        website. Please do not contact vZDC staff for support regarding ATC bookings, as we cannot
                        modify or intervene in those systems.

                        staffing only. To participate in an event, please complete the signup form provided on that
                        eventâ€™s page.

                        Controllers are strongly encouraged to staff their booked positions as scheduled. However, due
                        to the informal nature of the ATC booking system, there are minimal consequences for missed
                        bookings. Event signups, however, are still strictly enforced.
